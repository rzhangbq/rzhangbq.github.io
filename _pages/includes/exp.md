# ðŸ’» Previous Projects
- *2023.09 - 2024.06* **Designing a high-performance airfoil by advanced CFD and machine-learning methods** (Final year design project for aerospace engineering, [Prof. Fu Lin@HKUST](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/lin-fu))
  - Designing, implementing and evaluating machine-learning-based methods for airfoil shape optimization, and comparing results with numerical adjoint methods and experimental results
  - **Inspiration**:
    - Machine learning methods excel in identifying coarse global optima, while numerical adjoint methods excel in refining local optima
    - Combining these two methods could potentially yield improved results
- *2023.09 - 2024.06* **Adversarial or reinforcement learning-based closed-loop training strategy for PINN-based fluid simulators that generalize** (Final year project for computer science, [Prof. Dit-Yan YEUNG@HKUST](https://sites.google.com/view/dyyeung))
  - Designing, implementing and evaluating a closed-loop training strategy for PINN-based fluid simulator with adversarial or reinforcement learning, to achieve enhanced generalizability
  - **Inspiration**:
    - Closed-loop strategy can more efficiently explore the solution space
    - Training strategies like RL and AL can be used to form a closed-loop process

  - Designing, implementing and evaluating surrogate models for fluid structure interaction, conducting optimization with the resultant surrogate models
  - **Inspiration**:
    - Modeling transient fluid flow as a Markov process to enable single-step prediction of flow evolution
    - Introducing shape representation from the field of computer vision to enable monolithic modeling of fluid-structure interaction
