# 💻 Previous Projects
- *2023.09 - 2024.06* **Designing a high-performance airfoil by advanced CFD and machine-learning methods** ([Prof. Fu Lin@HKUST](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/lin-fu), Final Year Design Project for Aerospace Engineering)
  - Designing, implementing and evaluating machine-learning-based methods for airfoil shape optimization, and comparing results with numerical adjoint methods and experimental results
  - **Inspiration**:
    - Machine learning methods excel in identifying coarse global optima, while numerical adjoint methods excel in refining local optima

  - Designing, implementing and evaluating a closed-loop training strategy for PINN-based fluid simulator with adversarial or reinforcement learning, to achieve enhanced generalizability
  - **Inspiration**:
    - Closed-loop strategy can more efficiently explore the solution space
    - Training strategies like RL and AL can be used to form a closed-loop process
